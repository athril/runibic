# runibic: UniBic biclustering algorithm for R

This package contains implementation of UniBic biclustering algorithm for gene expression data [Wang2016]
The algorithm tries to locate trend-preserving biclusters within complex and noisy data.

## Introduction 

Since their first application to gene expression data [Cheng2000] biclustering algorithms have gained much popularity [Eren2012].
The reason for this is the ability of the methods to simultaneously detect valid patterns within the data that include only subset of rows and columns.

In this package we provide an improved implementation of UniBic biclustering algorithm. This state-of-the-art algorithm is said to outperform multiple biclustering methods on both synthetic and genetic datasets.
Our major contributions are reimplementing the method into more modern C++11 language as well as multiple improvements in code.


## Functions
This package provides the following functions:
* BCUnibic - UniBic biclustering algorithm for continuous data
* BCUnibicD - UniBic biclustering algorithm for discrete data
* pairwiseLCS - calculates Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between two vectors
* calculateLCS - calculates multiple LCS within the dataset and prepares input for the cluster function
* backtrackLCS - recovers the LCS from the matrix obtained using dynamic programming
* cluster - seeds rows based based on the results obtained from calculateLCS
* unisort - returns matrix of indexes based on the increasing order in each row
* discretize - performs discretization using Fibonacci heap (sorting method used originally in UniBic)


## Installation
The package may be installed as follows:
```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("athril/runibic")
```

## Example
This example presents how to use runibic package on gene expression dataset:
```r
library(runibic)
library(biclust)
data(BicatYeast)
input=BicatYeast[1:20,1:20]
res = biclust(method=BCUnibic(),input)
drawHeatmap(input, res, 1)
parallelCoordinates(input,res,1)
```

## Example
This example presents how to use runibic package on SummarizedExperiment:
```r
library(runibic)
library(SummarizedExperiment)
data(airway, package="airway")
se <- airway[1:20,]
runibic(se)
```
